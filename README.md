# Semantic-Analysis-on-a-corpus-of-1.6-million-sentences


In this project, I compared the performances of varioud models that can be used for semantic analysis. I used Bidrectional LSTM , GRU , BIDIRECTIONAL GRU , BI DIRECTIONAL LSTM on varying data sizes . I found that model with multiple LSTM layers gve best  results. I used 1.6 million sentances for the final model. THe link of cleaned corpus is given in code . its a kaggle semantic analysis dataset which has twitter data. YOu can even downloas the tsv files and check on tensorflow.embedded.projector .
